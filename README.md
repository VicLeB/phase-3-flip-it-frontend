Flip-it

Project pitch:
	Welcome to Flip-it your go to web app for those who are looking to search and create home flipping projects. Here a user will be able to view home flipping projects that are currently in progress and have the opportunity to add their own project!

User stories:
As a user I will arrive at the home page and find a list of home flipping projects that are underway along with their address.

As a user, I may also search for home flipping projects by city using a search bar.

As a user I have the ability to add my own house that I am flipping to the list of homes with a form. I may add rooms and their projects

As a user I can select one of the homes and view all the current projects occurring at that location. These projects will be sorted by room.

As a user, when I select a room, I will view which projects are started. Each project will have a description and include which tools and supplies/ parts are needed to complete it.

As a user, I can add and/or  remove tools and supplies to a project in a specified room of a home.

As a user I can see the total cost of a project.

As a user I may update the status of a project as complete or incomplete.
